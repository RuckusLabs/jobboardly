          <h4>Custom Domains</h4>
          <p>Custom domains allow Job Boardly users to use their own domain name, rather than a subdomain of Job Boardly. This gives users a professional-looking URL that is memorable and easy to share.</p>
          <p>Setting up a custom domain is simple and can be done in the Job Boardly dashboard.</p>
          <p>Using a custom domain also adds credibility to the user's job board. It creates a more professional appearance and can help establish trust with job seekers and employers. Additionally, a custom domain can improve the search engine ranking of the job board, as search engines tend to give preference to websites with their own domain name.</p>
          <p>Overall, custom domains are a great way to take your job board to the next level. By using your own domain name, you can create a more professional and trustworthy appearance, and improve your job board's search engine ranking. With Job Boardly, setting up a custom domain is quick and easy, so you can start reaping the benefits right away.</p>

          <h4>Stripe Integration</h4>
          <p>Job Boardly makes it easy to monetize your job board through customizable job post pricing options.</p>
          <p>Using our Stripe integration, you can quickly and easily set up payment options for basic, promoted, and featured job posts. Our Stripe Checkout integration allows users to easily and securely pay for job postings.</p>
          <h5>Basic jobs</h5>
          <p>Basic job posts are a great option for companies who want to post a job without extra attention. These job posts are listed on the job board with no highlighting and move further down the list as new jobs are posted.</p>
          <h5>Promoted jobs</h5>
          <p>Promoted job posts offer a bit more attention for companies who want to stand out. These job posts are highlighted and move further down the list as new jobs are posted. Promoted job posts catch job seekers' attention and increase visibility, making it easier for companies to find the right fit for their job.</p>
          <h5>Featured jobs</h5>
          <p>For maximum visibility, featured job posts are the way to go. These job posts are highlighted and stay pinned to the top of the job listings, ensuring that they are seen by job seekers before any other jobs. Featured job posts are a great option for companies who are looking for quick results or are having difficulty filling a job position.</p>
          <h5>Connect External Payment Provider</h5>
          <p>We also allow for connecting to most external payment providers through a payment link. See full instructions on <a href="https://www.jobboardly.com/support/connecting-an-external-payment-provider">how to set up external payment providers here.</a></p>

          <p>You can create custom codes with specific discounts and usage limits to ensure you are running promotions that align with your business goals.</p>
